# DuckDB Adapter Implementation Plan for dbt-fusion
## Incremental Development with Validation Checkpoints

## Overview

This plan is designed for incremental development where each step produces immediately testable results. After each step, we can validate that our changes work before proceeding to the next step. This approach minimizes risk and allows for course correction at each stage.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Add DuckDB to Type System (15 min)
**Goal**: Get DuckDB recognized as a valid adapter type in the codebase

**Changes**:
1. Add `DuckDB` variant to `AdapterType` enum in `base_adapter.rs`
2. Add `DuckDB` case to `From<AdapterType> for Dialect` mapping
3. Add `DuckDB` variant to `Dialect` enum in `dialect.rs`
4. Update `Display` and `FromStr` implementations

**Validation**: 
- Project compiles successfully
- Can create `AdapterType::DuckDB` in code
- `AdapterType::DuckDB.to_string()` works

**Test Command**: `cargo build`

**Commit Step**: After successful validation, commit changes with descriptive message

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All changes implemented and committed (commit: 56f27df)

---

### Step 2: Add DuckDB Backend to XDBC Layer (15 min)
**Goal**: Get DuckDB recognized as a valid backend in the connection layer

**Changes**:
1. Add `DuckDB` variant to `Backend` enum in `dbt-xdbc/src/driver.rs`
2. Update `Display` implementation
3. Add DuckDB library name (`"adbc_driver_duckdb"`)
4. Add DuckDB entrypoint (`b"duckdb_adbc_init"`)
5. Add version constant

**Validation**:
- Project compiles successfully  
- Can create `Backend::DuckDB` instances

---

### Step 4: Implement Minimal DuckDB Relation Types (30 min)

5. Add basic `new_connection()` that returns an error for now

**Validation**:

## Validation Strategy

### After Each Step:
1. **Compile Check**: Ensure code compiles without errors
2. **Basic Functionality**: Test that new functionality works as expected
3. **Integration Check**: Verify that changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Manual Testing**: Quick manual verification when appropriate
5. **Commit Changes**: After successful validation, commit all changes with a descriptive message

### Rollback Strategy:
If any step fails validation:
1. Revert changes for that step
2. Analyze what went wrong
3. Modify approach if needed
4. Re-attempt the step

### Progress Tracking:
- Each step should take 15-90 minutes to implement
- Total estimated time: ~12-15 hours of development
- Can be spread across multiple sessions
- Clear stopping/starting points at each step

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Before Starting:
1. Ensure DuckDB ADBC driver is available on the system
2. Verify ADBC libraries are properly installed
3. Confirm development environment is set up

### During Development:
- Each step builds on the previous step
- No step should be attempted without completing previous steps
- Validation must pass before proceeding to next step

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Can test and validate at each step
2. **Low Risk**: Easy to rollback if something doesn't work
3. **Incremental Progress**: Always have a working version
4. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate issues to specific steps
5. **Flexibility**: Can adjust approach based on what we learn at each step

This plan is designed to be executed by Claude Code with human supervision, allowing for frequent validation and course correction as needed.
